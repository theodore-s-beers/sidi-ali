title: "Editor's introduction by Fran Pritchett"

"Mirat ul-Memalik" seeks to be a "mirror" of the "countries" (_memalik_ is the
plural of _mulk_) through which Sidi Ali Reis traveled on his long, difficult
journey home after his shipwreck. It's extremely useful in that capacity, but
it's also a wonderful reflection of its author's own temperament and view of the
world. It moves fast, and makes for enjoyable reading.

My editing has consisted of correcting obvious typographical and other errors; I
have also adjusted the punctuation for clarity and ease of reading, and broken a
few extremely long paragraphs into shorter ones. I haven't sought to retain
diacritics; but there weren't all that many in Vambéry's original text anyway.
Standardization has been only very lightly imposed, mostly since Vambéry himself
is so casual about it: he writes, for example, both "Ghazel" and "Gazel," and
writes each of them either with or without a capital G; and similarly for many
other names and terms. Where a name or term was important and interesting, I've
tried to keep its spelling, even if archaic, consistent throughout. I haven't
changed his transliteration system: "Ekber" has not been made into "Akbar," or
"Djagatai" into "Chughtai." All comments added by me are in \[\[double
brackets\]\] in the text itself.

All the footnotes are Vambéry's; but not all Vambéry's footnotes have been
included. A few very short definitional ones have been incorporated in
parentheses into the text, where they join many other such parenthesized
definitions that he provides. Others have been omitted or shortened, especially
those that deal with obscure points of medieval Turkish vocabulary and grammar.
I tried to retain those that had historical or cultural interest in their own
right. When Vambéry found an expression too obscure to translate, he replaced it
with "..."; I have retained this usage. But then he usually reproduced and
discussed it in a footnote as well, and such footnotes I have omitted. So any
serious Turkish scholar will naturally want to go directly to Vambéry's text;
but for the general reader, the present version should be satisfactory. I
dedicate it to my students in "Islam in South Asia: an Introduction," whose
enjoyment of this text has led me to make this version of it.

Ottoman culture is far afield for me, but for some quick basic background
information you could always start with
[The Ottomans](http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/OTTOMAN/OTTOMAN1.HTM), from Prof.
Richard Hooker's site, or with
[Suleiman the Magnificent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent)
from Wikipedia. About the janissaries:
["The Tribute of Children"](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/islam/1493janissaries.html),
from the Medieval Sourcebook; or
["The Turkish Letters" of Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1555busbecq.html),
from the Modern History Sourcebook. On the literary side, you could take a look
at
["Selections from the Legends and Poetry of the Turks"](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/turkishpoetry1.html),
from the Medieval Sourcebook; or
["Ottoman Lyric Poetry"](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~sibel/poetry/books/ottoman/index.html),
by Walter Andrews et al. The Medieval Sourcebook also provides another version
of ["Mirat ul-Memalik"](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/16CSidi1.html),
but unfortunately it contains many undetected OCR typos.

And as for our translator, Prof. Arminius Vambéry, I've discovered two articles
by him:
"[England in the Orient](http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABQ7578-0156-46)"
(1893) and
"[Russia and England](http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABQ7578-0160-62)"
(1895).
