    <h2>IX. Our experience in Bakhtar-Zemin, i.e., in Kabulistan</h2>
    <p>
      In the beginning of the month Djemazi-ul-Evvel we left the river Nilab and
      turned toward Kabul. For fear of the Afghans under Adam Khan, we made a
      quick march through the night, and at daybreak we arrived at the foot of
      the mountain. So far the Afghans had not seen us, but by the time we had
      reached the top there were thousands of them gathered together. We seized
      our guns, and with God’s help managed to get out of their way, and came to
      the town of Pershuer, i.e., Peshawer. Soon after, we crossed the Khaiber
      Pass, and reached Djushai. In the mountains we saw two rhinoceroses
      (Kerkedans),<a
        href="#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1"

        ><sup>1</sup></a
      >
      each the size of a small elephant; they have a horn on their nose about
      two inches long. In Abyssinia these animals are much more plentiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently we reached Laghman,<a
        href="#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>2</sup></a
      >
      and after a very toilsome journey through Hezareland,<a
        href="#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"

      >
      we entered Kabulistan and its capital, Kabul. Here I visited the two sons
      of Humayun, Mehemmed Hekim Mirza and Ferrukh Fal Mirza; I also saw Mun’im
      Khan, and after presenting the ferman from Humayun, I was treated with
      much honour. Kabul itself is a beautiful city, surrounded by mountains
      covered with snow, and pleasure-gardens with running brooks. Pleasure and
      merriment prevailed everywhere, feasting and banqueting were the order of
      the day. In every corner were gaily dressed, slender Lulis<a
        href="#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>4</sup></a
      >
      enticing one with music and song to join the merry crowd; the populace, in
      fact, seemed to have no thought for anything but for pleasure and
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who would long for Huris and the Paradise, whose good fortune has brought
      him amongst the Lulis of Kabul?”
    </p>
    <p>
      We, however, had no time for such frivolities; our only aim and object was
      to reach home as soon as possible. Mun’im Khan remarked that the roads
      were snowed up, that the Hindu Kush could not possibly be passed, and that
      it would be far better for us to wait a few days in Kabul; but I quickly
      replied that men could overcome mountains, if they had the mind to do so.
      Thereupon the Governor commanded Mir Nezri, the Chief of the Ferashi and
      Peshai, to accompany me, and his men were to conduct our horses and goods
      safely across the mountain pass. We left accordingly in the beginning of
      Djemazi-ul-Evvel and came to Karabag,<a
        href="#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>5</sup></a
      >
      and from there to Tcharikar and Pervane or Mervan.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Nezri’s native country. He collected his men, and they took us
      across to the other side of the mountain. It was a very difficult passage,
      but we accomplished it that day, and spent the night in a village at the
      foot of the pass.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch-x">X. The condition of Badakhshan and Khatlan</h2>
    <p>
      Early in the month of Redjeb we came to the city of Anderab, and journeyed
      from there through Badakhshan to Talikan, where I had an interview with
      Suleiman Shah<a
        href="#fn6"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>6</sup></a
      >
      and his son Ibrahim Mirza. On the day of our arrival the Mirza had met us,
      and received me in his pleasure-garden; I offered him some presents and a
      Ghazel. The Mirza, who understood poetry, entered into a poetical
      competition with me, and introduced me next day to his father, to whom I
      also offered gifts and a Ghazel. The Sovereign also showed me much
      attention, and loaded me with signs of his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was hostility between Pir Mohammed Khan, the ruler of Balkh, and
      Borak Khan, the ruler of Transoxania, and the roads were made unsafe; the
      more so as Pir Mohammed’s younger brother had raised a revolt in Kunduz,
      Kavadian, and Termed, which districts were now in great tumult. They
      advised me therefore to travel by the way of Badakhshan and Khatlan,<a
        href="#fn7"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref7"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>7</sup></a
      >
      and both Suleiman and his son presented me with horses and garments of
      honour, besides giving me a letter of recommendation to Djihanghir Ali,
      the ruler of Khatlan, who had married his younger sister; and so I
      journeyed to Kishm, the capital of Badakhshan.<a

    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the Sovereign’s pleasure-garden, and Humayun’s garden Duabe, and
      proceeded from Kalai Zafar<a
        href="#fn9"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref9"

        id="fnref10"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>10</sup></a
      >
      I approached Dalli, in Khatlan, from the Kashgar (eastern?) side, and made
      a pilgrimage to the grave of Seid Ali Hamadani, and from there I went to
      Kulaba,<a
        href="#fn11"

      where I met with Djihanghir Ali Khan; and after presenting my letter of
      recommendation he gave me an escort of 50 men to conduct me to Charsui,
      where I crossed the Pul-i-Senghin<a
        href="#fn12"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref12"

      (stone bridge), and dismissed the men who had escorted us.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch-xi">XI. Events in Turan, i.e. Transoxania</h2>
    <p>
      On the day that I crossed the bridge, I first set foot on Transoxanian
      soil. After a day’s rest I proceeded to Bazar No (New Market), and from
      there to a little place called Tchiharshembe, where I visited the grave of
      the Khodja Yaakub Tcharkhi. Then on to Tchaganian,
      i.e. Hissar-i-Shadman.<a
        href="#fn13"

        id="fnref13"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>13</sup></a

      I visited Timur Sultan, the Kagalga<a
        href="#fn14"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref14"
        role="doc-noteref"

      of the Ozbeg rulers, and passed Mount Senghirdek,<a
        href="#fn15"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref15"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>15</sup></a
      >
      where it always rains and a considerable stream is formed at the foot of
      the mountain, and I marveled at the wonderful works of God. The next
      station was Sehri-Sebz, i.e., Kesh, where I met Hashim Sultan, who gave me
      permission to continue my journey to Samarkand. With great difficulty we
      got across the mountain<a
        href="#fn16"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref16"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>16</sup></a
      >
      situated between the two last-named places; we touched the little town of
      Mazar, and in the beginning of Shaaban we reached Samarkand, which is a
      perfect paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I saw Borak Khan<a
        href="#fn17"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref17"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>17</sup></a
      >
      (more correctly called Noruz Ahmed), who, in return for my humble
      offerings, gave me a horse and garments of honour. It was this same Borak
      Khan to whom his Majesty the Padishah had sent cannon and guns by the hand
      of Sheikhs Abdullatif and Dadash. At the time of my arrival Abdullatif
      Khan, the ruler of Samarkand, was dead,<a
        href="#fn18"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref18"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>18</sup></a
      >
      and Borak had taken his place. Pir Mohammed Khan in Balkh, and Burhan Seid
      Khan<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>19</sup></a
      >
      in Bokhara, declared their independence, and Borak’s first business was to
      settle this matter. He began by taking Samarkand and proceeded to
      Shehr-i-Sebz, where a great battle was fought, in which the Ketkhuda
      (overseer) of the Osman soldiers fell. He then took the stronghold and
      marched to Bokhara, which place he laid siege to. Seid Burhan, the ruler
      of Bokhara, made peace with Borak, relinquished the place to him, and
      retired to Karakul, where the brother of Pir Mohammed Khan then reigned.
      He, however, gave up the place to Seid Burhan.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Borak Khan entered Samarkand, the Aga of the Osmans<a
        href="#fn20"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref20"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>20</sup></a
      >
      had just started with few men on their way to Turkey, having taken the way
      of Tashkend and Turkestan. Ahmed Tchaush was also on the point of
      returning to Turkey by the way of Bokhara and Kharezm, for part of the
      Janissaries had enlisted under Seid Burhan, and the remainder joined his
      son. About 150 remained faithful to Borak Khan. When he had communicated
      all this to me, he added: “I am now as a liar before his Majesty the
      Sultan of Turkey, for I can do nothing, but if thou wilt help me,
      something may yet be done.” He offered me the government of a Province,
      but I said that with such a small army nothing could be done; moreover
      that without the consent of my Padishah, I could not stir in the matter.
      He thereupon proposed to send an envoy to the Sublime Porte to explain the
      situation. As a matter of fact he had already decided to send Sadr Alem, a
      descendant of Khodja Ahmed Jesewi,<a
        href="#fn21"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref21"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>21</sup></a
      >
      and gave him a letter in which he expressed his willingness in the future
      to satisfy every wish of the Sultan. He discharged me, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my stay in Samarkand I made a pilgrimage to the grave of the
      prophet Daniel, to the place of the Khidr (Elias), to the cloak and to the
      wooden shoes of the Prophet, and also to the Koran written by Ali
      himself.<a
        href="#fn22"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref22"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>22</sup></a
      >
      Besides these places I visited the graves of the following sheikhs and
      sages: the author of Hidayet, Ebu Mansur Matridi; Shah-Zinde, Khodja
      Abdullah, Khodja Abdi-birun, Khodja Abdi-derum, the Tchopanata, and the
      Kazizade of Rum, and the grave of the 444,000 Transoxanian sages.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Borak Khan. One day, while talking together, he asked me
      which of all the cities I had visited pleased me most. I replied with the
      following stanza:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Far from home no one longs for Paradise.<br />
        For in his eyes his native town is superior even to Baghdad.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>“Thou hast spoken well,” said the Khan.</p>
    <p>
      Now as regards the embassage to Constantinople, Sadr Alem proposed to go
      by Turkestan; but when he was told that the Nogai tribe of the Mangit
      committed violence upon travelers, and that the roads swarmed with robbers
      and highwaymen who gave no quarter to Musulmans,<a
        href="#fn23"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref23"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>23</sup></a
      >
      but plundered and ill-treated any that came in their way, he decided to
      travel through Bokhara. Unfortunately, just then the news came that Seid
      Burhan had again declared war with Borak Khan, and that the latter’s son
      Kharezm Shah had been attacked. Borak Khan advised me thereupon to remain
      at Ghidjduvan until the return of the envoy. If no hostilities took place
      we might travel by that way, but otherwise we were to wait until he sent
      some one to conduct us safely through Bokhara. To this I agreed. On the
      fifth of Ramazan we started, touched Kala and Kermineh, crossed the river
      of Samarkand<a
        href="#fn24"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref24"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>24</sup></a
      >
      at Duabe, and so arrived at Ghidjduvan,<a
        href="#fn25"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref25"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>25</sup></a
      >
      where I visited the grave of Khodja Abdul Khalik.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Mirza (?) was not here, and no news concerning him could be
      obtained, we went on to Pul Rabat. Meanwhile the troops of Prince Kharezm
      Shah had prepared for battle. Suddenly Khan Ali Bey, the Prince’s tutor,
      accosted us with the question whither we were going. When I replied: “To
      Bokhara,” he said: “Seid Burhan, the ruler of Bokhara, threatens to attack
      Prince Kharezm Shah, and we pray thee to help us.” “How now!” I cried, “we
      help no man; Borak Khan has not requested us to do so; on the contrary, he
      has charged us to go to Ghidjduvan, and there to await the return of the
      envoy.” So we continued on our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached Minar (Spire) about 100 redcoats (Ala tehapan) rushed
      down upon us, crying: “In the name of the Mirza, turn back,” and at the
      same time they struck one of my companions. Immediately we prepared to
      fight, when a Seid sprang forward and commanded the Ozbegs to stop. Both
      sides held back, and the Seid announced that the Mirza sent us greeting
      and desired us not to proceed any farther, but to look on from a distance.
      So we were compelled to turn back. With ten of my companions I had an
      interview with the Mirza, who renewed his request that we should help him;
      but I refused again, whereupon ten guns were forcibly taken from us, and
      we were commanded to remain mere spectators. The Prince’s bearing was very
      haughty before he had sighted the enemy, for as the proverb says:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Our own fist is always of iron,<br />
        Until we receive the first box on the ear.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      But no sooner had Seid Burhan appeared in sight from the opposite
      direction, than the Prince retreated across the bridge to the Rabat
      (Karvanserai). I went on with six companions, which I left behind me in
      the court of the kiosk. Seid Burhan advanced with 1,000 Kizil-Ayaks, i.e.,
      young men from Bokhara, and 40 Turkish archers, therefore well equipped
      for war. In a moment he defeated the Prince—who, being wounded by a
      bullet, took flight, leaving his colours, musical and other military
      instruments behind him on the battle-field. Of my three companions which
      fled with the Prince, one was wounded by a lance and died soon after; and
      while the others retreated with the Ozbegs into the Rabat, where they were
      attacked by Seid Burhan, I went on to meet the army to inquire after the
      Mirza, leaving my horse in charge of two men. I heard that he was
      quartered close to the Rabat, and asked to be conducted into his presence;
      and just as I was crossing the bridge, attended by a few men, some villain
      wounded me with an arrow. This was the signal for a general attack; swords
      were raised on all sides, and I was very near losing my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the attack had been witnessed by the Osmans serving under the
      Khan; they had recognized me, and came to my rescue, calling out: “This
      man is the guest of our Prince, what then is the meaning of this?” The
      Ozbeghi (commander of 10 men) immediately stopped the attack and apprized
      the Khan of what had taken place, whereupon the latter, a glorious youth,
      hastened to me, embraced me, and begged my forgiveness, for it was by
      accident, he said, that I had become mixed up in the battle, and I had
      been attacked on the principle of the proverb which says: ‘Wet and dry
      burn together.’ He commissioned two officers to conduct us over the
      bridge, during which transport two more of my people were attacked, and
      received sword wounds. I lost on this occasion a beautiful led-horse, all
      my cooking apparatus, one pack-horse, and 10 saddle-horses, which were
      stolen by the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With much difficulty I got across the bridge; and while I was resting at a
      little distance, the Khan, to please me, ordered the Turkish soldiers
      stationed in the Rabat to hand the place over to me, as we were innocent
      and free from all reproach. As I approached the place I called out: “Stop
      fighting; I am here, and the Khan will pardon you for my sake.” Thus the
      Rabat fell into my hands, and with it some of the lost horses, but many of
      the firearms were irrevocably lost. My two men who had been taken prisoner
      in the fight had escaped, and so we proceeded to the town, which we
      reached that night. Seid Burhan spoke thus to me: “Be thou my guide in
      this and in the next world; this land shall henceforth belong to thy
      Padishah, thou shalt rule in Bokhara and I will retire to Karakol.” “Not
      so,” was my reply, “if thou gave me the whole land of Transoxania I could
      not stay here. Know, O Khan! that I shall report before the Sublime Porte
      the injustice which has been done to thee, and my glorious Padishah will
      be gracious unto thee, and possibly the government of these provinces will
      be entrusted to thy care.”
    </p>
    <p>
      These words pleased the Khan; he gave a banquet in my honour and showed me
      much kindness, and during the fortnight which I spent in Bokhara he
      visited me every day in the pleasure-garden which served as my residence.
      I composed a Ghazel in his honour, which highly delighted him and led to
      many poetical discussions. When at last I desired permission to continue
      my journey, he demanded of me that I should give him our iron guns in
      exchange for his brass ones. He pressed me so hard that I was compelled to
      give in, and received 40 brass muskets in return for all the iron ones
      which we had left. I also had to exchange my led-horse for a gelding,
      besides giving him two precious books.

      Meanwhile the envoy from Borak Khan had arrived, who apologized to me for
      his son (Kharezm Shah), and made peace with Seid Burhan through the
      mediation of the Ghidjduvani Abdul Sultan. Thus peace and security were
      once more restored.

      I delayed in Bokhara to make pilgrimages to the graves of Bahaeddin
      Nakishbendi, Kazi Khan, Tchar Bekir, Khodja Ebn Hifz Kebir, Sadr
      esh-Sheriat, Tadj esh-Sheriat, Seid Mir Kelal (the spiritual head of
      Baha-eddin), Sultan Ismail the Samanide, Eyub and Sarakhsi; and after that
      I journeyed to Kharezm.

      Our way led first to Karakol, then to Farab where we crossed the Oxus in
      ships, and early in the month Shavval I touched Iranian soil, namely
      Khorassan. The first town I stopped at was Tchardjui,<a

      it was not safe for one man to go alone to draw water; but at last, after
      ten days of unutterable weariness, we reached Hezaresp, and from there in
      five days, Khiva, where I visited the grave of Pehlevan Mahmud Pir.

            Suleiman Shah was the son of Khan Mirza the Wise, a cousin of
            Baber’s. He had usurped the throne of Badakhshan in 1508, and was
