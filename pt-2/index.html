    <h2>VI. What happened in the Province of Gujarat</h2>
    <p>
      After five days, in God’s mercy, the wind somewhat abated. All that was
      saved of the wreckage, cannon and other armament, we left with the
      Governor of Daman, Malik Esed, who since the time of Sultan Ahmed, the
      ruler of Gujarat, had held office there. In the harbor were some Djonk’s,
      i.e., Monsoon ships, belonging to Samiri [[= the Zamorin]], the ruler of
      Calicut [[= correcting V’s “Calcutta”]]. The captains came on board our
      ship and assured us of the devotion of their chief to the Padishah. They
      brought us a letter which said that Samiri was waging war day and night
      against the Portuguese Infidels, and that he was expecting the arrival of
      an Imperial feet from Egypt under the guidance of the pilot Ali, which was
      to put the Portuguese to flight. Melik Esed, the Governor, gave me to
      understand that the fleet of the Infidels was on its way, that it behooved
      us to avoid it and, if possible, to reach the fortress of Surat. This news
      frightened the crew. Some of them immediately took service under Melik
      Esed, and some went ashore in the boats and proceeded by land to Surat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained on board with a few faithful of the men, and after procuring a
      Dindjuy, or pilot-boat, for each vessel, we set out for the harbor of
      Surat. After great difficulties we reached the open. Presently the
      Kutwal,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>1</sup></a
      >
      Aga Hamsa, hailed us with a letter from Umad-el-mulk, the Grand Vizier of
      Sultan Ahmed, who informed us that there were large numbers of Infidels
      about, and that Daman being a free port we had better be careful. He would
      allow us to come to Surat if we liked, as we were now in most perilous
      waters. This was exactly what we wanted to do, so we struggled on for five
      days longer, sailing at the flow, riding at anchor at the ebb of the tide,
      until at last we reached the harbor of Surat, fully three months after our
      departure from Basrah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was the joy of the Mohammedans at Surat when they saw us come; they
      hailed us as their deliverers (lit. Khidr), and said: “You have come to
      Gujarat in troublous times; never since the days of Noah has there been a
      flood like unto this last, but neither is it within the memory of man that
      a ship from Rum (Turkey) has landed on these coasts. We fervently hoped
      that God in his mercy would soon send an Ottoman fleet to Gujarat, to save
      this land for the Ottoman Empire and to deliver us from the Indian
      unbelievers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of the disturbances was this: After the death of Sultan Bahadur,
      the ruler of Gujarat, one of his relatives, a youth of twelve years old,
      had succeeded to the throne. The army had acknowledged him, but one of the
      nobles, Nasir-ul-Mulk, had refused to take the oath of allegiance, and had
      raised the umbrella (banner) of sovereignty on his own behalf. He had many
      adherents, took the stronghold of Burudj,<a
        href="#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>2</sup></a
      >
      left a sufficient garrison to keep it, proceeded himself to another town,
      and then called in the aid of the Governor of the Infidels (Portuguese) at
      Goa, promising that in return for his services the harbors on the coast of
      Gujarat, viz., Daman, Surat, Burudj, Ketbaye, Sumenat, Minglur, and
      Furmeyan, should be thrown open to the Portuguese, while he would retire
      to the land of the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sultan Ahmed had immediately collected an army to go to Burudj, and when
      informed of our arrival he took from our troops 200 gunners and other men,
      and advanced toward Burudj. On the third day we who were left behind were
      attacked by the Infidel captains of Goa, Diu, Shiyul, Besai, and the
      Provador; five in all, commanding 7 large galleons and 80 gurabs. We went
      ashore, pitched our tents, and threw up entrenchments; for two whole
      months we were busy preparing for battle. But the tyrant Nasir-ul-Mulk,
      who had joined with the Infidels, had hired murderers to kill me; they
      were, however, discovered by the guard, and fled. Again another time he
      tried to poison my food; but being warned by the Kutwal of Surat, this
      attempt to take my life also failed. Meanwhile Sultan Ahmed had taken the
      stronghold of Burudj and sent two of his officers, Khudavend and
      Djihanghir, with elephants and troops to Surat, while he proceeded to
      Ahmedabad, where a youth called Ahmed, a relation of Sultan Ahmed, had in
      the meantime raised a revolt. A battle followed in which the usurper was
      wounded, Hasan Khan, one of his adherents, killed, and his army put to
      fiight. Sultan Ahmed reascended his throne, and as Nasir-ul-Mulk died of
      vexation over his misfortunes, peace was once more restored in Gujarat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Infidels heard of this they sent an Envoy to Khudavend Khan to
      say that they did not mind so much about Surat, but that their hostility
      was chiefly directed toward the Admiral of Egypt, viz., my humble person.
      They demanded that I should be given up to them, but were refused; and my
      soldiers would have killed the Envoy, but I reminded them that we were on
      foreign soil and must commit no rash deeds. It so happened that a runaway
      Infidel gunner from one of my ships had enlisted on the ship of the envoy,
      and knowing a good deal about our affairs, he had undertaken to prevent
      our departure after the holiday of Kurban. No sooner had this come to the
      knowledge of my men than they attacked the envoy’s ship and captured the
      Infidel, who was executed on the spot, greatly to the alarm of the Envoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in Gujarat a tree of the palm tribe, called tari agadji
      (millet-tree). From its branches cups are suspended, and when the cut end
      of a branch is placed into one of these vessels a sweet liquid, something
      of the nature of arrack, flows out in a continuous stream; and this fluid,
      by exposure to the heat of the sun, presently changes into a most
      wonderful wine. Therefore at the foot of all such trees drinking-booths
      have been placed, which are a great attraction to the soldiers. Some of my
      men, having indulged in the forbidden drink, determined to kill their
      Serdar. One of these profligates, Yagmur by name, one evening after sunset
      surprised Hussain Aga, the Serdar of the Circassians. A few comrades
      rushed to his assistance, there was some fighting, and two young men were
      wounded, and one, Hadji Memi, was killed. Then the soldiers pressed round,
      and implored me to punish the evil-doers, but I again reminded them that
      we were on foreign soil, in the land of a foreign Padishah, and that our
      laws had no force here. “What,” they cried, “the laws of our Padishah hold
      good everywhere. You are our Admiral, judge according to our law, and we
      will be the executioners!” Thereupon I pronounced judgment according to
      the law of the Koran, which says: “Eye for eye, life for life, nose for
      nose, ear for ear,” etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was executed, and peace restored. When the nobles of the Begs
      heard of the occurrence they took the lesson to heart, and the Envoy
      immediately hired a conveyance and went to Sultan Ahmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my troops were getting dissatisfied. In Surat, Khudavend Khan had been
      paying them from 50 to 60 paras per day, and in Burudj, Adil Khan had done
      the same. At last their pent-up feelings burst forth and they argued as
      follows: “It is now nearly two years since we have received any pay, our
      goods are lost and the ships dismantled; the hulks are old, and our return
      to Egypt is practically made impossible.” The end was that the greater
      part of them took service in Gujarat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deserted ships, with all their tools and implements, were given over
      to Khudavend Khan, under condition that he should immediately remit to the
      Sublime Porte the price agreed upon for the sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving a confirmatory note to this effect, both from Khudavend
      Khan and Adil Khan, I started on my journey to Ahmedabad,<a

      in the beginning of Muharram of the year 962 (end of November 1552),
      accompanied by Mustafa Aga, the Ketkhuda (chief officer) of the Egyptian
      Janissaries, and Ali Aga, the Captain of the gunners (both of which had
      remained faithful to their Padishah), and with about 50 men. A few days
      took us from Burudj to Belodra<a
        href="#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"

      and from there we proceeded to Champanir.<a
        href="#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>5</sup></a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      On our way we saw some very curious trees, whose crowns reached up to the
      sky, and the branches swarmed with bats of such extraordinary size that
      their wings on the stretch measured 40 inches across. The most curious
      part about the trees, however, was that the roots hung down from the
      branches and, when touching the ground, planted themselves and produced
      new trees. Thus from one tree, from ten to twenty new ones sprung up. The
      name of this tree is the Tobi tree,<a
        href="#fn6"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>6</sup></a
      >
      and more than a thousand(?) people can find shelter under its shade.
      Besides these we saw several Zokum trees.<a
        href="#fn7"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref7"

      >
      Parrots were very plentiful, and as for the monkeys, thousands of them
      made their appearance in our camp every evening. They carried their young
      in their arms, made the most ridiculous grimaces, and strongly brought to
      our minds the stories of Djihan Shah, according to whom these animals live
      in a community but acknowledge no head among them. At nightfall they
      always retired to their own place.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a great many vicissitudes we at last arrived in Mahmudabad,<a
        href="#fn8"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref8"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>8</sup></a
      >
      and after a journey of 50 days in Ahmedabad the Capital of Gujarat. There
      I visited the Sultan, his Grand Vizier Imad-ul-Mulk, and other
      dignitaries. The Sultan, to whom I presented my credentials, was pleased
      to receive me most graciously, and he assured me of his devotion to our
      glorious Padishah. He gave me a horse, a team of camels, and money for the
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cherkes, in the vicinity of Ahmedabad, is the grave of Sheik Ahmed
      Magrebi, which I visited. One day, being at the house of Imad-ul-Mulk, I
      met the Infidel Envoy, and our host addressed him in this way, “We have
      need of the Sultan of Turkey. Our ships touch the ports of his Empire, and
      if we were not free to do so, it would be bad for us. Moreover, he is the
      Padishah of the Islamitic world, and it is not seemly that we should be
      expected to deliver up his Admiral to you.” I became very angry at this
      speech and cried: “Hold thy cursed tongue! Thou foundest me with a
      shattered fleet, but I swear by God Almighty thou shalt see ere long not
      only Ormuz, but Goa itself, yield before the victorious arms of the great
      Padishah!”<a
        href="#fn9"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref9"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>9</sup></a
      >
      To which the unbeliever made the following answer: “Henceforth not so much
      as a bird will be able to leave the ports of India.” I replied: “One need
      not necessarily go by water, there is a land route also.” He was silent
      after that, and the subject was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after this Sultan Ahmed offered me the command of the Province
      of Burudj, with a very large income, but I refused, saying that I would
      not stay if he gave me the whole of the land. One night in my dream I saw
      the Khalifa Murteza Ali. I had a piece of paper before me with Ali’s seal
      upon it. With this seal, the seal of God, to help me, away with all fear,
      for in its strength all foreign waters were mine to command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I told my dream to my companions, and all were glad with me.
      I asked for permission to depart, and the ruler granted my request out of
      respect for our Padishah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the learned<a

      there is a tribe which they call the <em>Bats</em>, whose business it is
      to escort merchants or travelers from one land into another, and for a
      very small renumeration they guarantee their perfect safety. Should the
      Rajputs, i.e. the mounted troops of the land, attack the caravan, the Bats
      point their daggers at their own breast, and threaten to kill themselves
      if they should presume to do the slightest harm to the travelers entrusted
      to their care. And out of respect for the Bats, the Rajputs generally
      desist from their evil purpose, and the travelers proceed on their way
      unmolested. Occasionally, however, the Bats carry out their threat,
      otherwise it would have no force. But if such a thing does happen, if a
      caravan is attacked and the suicide of the Bats becomes necessary, this is
      considered a terrible calamity, and the superstition of the people demands
      that the offenders be put to death, and not only the offenders themselves,
      but the chief of the Rajputs deems it necessary to kill their sons and
      daughters also; in fact, to exterminate the whole of their race. The
      Mohammedans of Ahmedabad had given us two such Bats as an escort, and so,
      about the middle of Safar of the said year, we started on our overland
      journey to Turkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five days we reached Patna,<a
        href="#fn12"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref12"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>12</sup></a
      >
      traveling in carriages, and visited the grave of Sheikh Nizam, the Pir
      (spiritual chief) of Patna. Here Shir Khan and his brother Musa Khan had
      collected an army, to fight Behluj Khan, the ruler of Radanpoor.<a
        href="#fn13"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref13"
        role="doc-noteref"
        ><sup>13</sup></a
      >
      For fear of our siding with their enemies, the people tried to retain us,
      and would not allow us to proceed on our journey until the battle should
      be over. We showed them, however, that we had not come to render either
      party any assistance, but that we only wanted to continue our journey in
      peace, and had a pass from their ruler to that effect. Then at last they
      let us go, and after five days we came to Radanpoor, where I was presented
      to Mahmud Khan; but he treated me very rudely, and insisted on forcibly
      detaining three of my companions before he would consent to our departure.
      On the way we met some friendly Rajputs; their Beg was of great service to
      us, and gave me a letter of protection (free pass). The camels were hired,
      and after dismissing the Bats which the people of Ahmedabad had sent with
      us, we continued our journey.

            Very characteristic is the piece of poetry here introduced. It is
            probably a Turkish sea-song of that time. It says:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              We roam the waters far and wide,<br />
              And bring confusion upon our enemies;<br />
              Revenge and hatred is our Motto,<br />
              For we are Khaireddin’s troops.
            </p>
